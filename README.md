## APIs

### Notify: 
Notify README

CONFIGURATION
The first thing to do is to register and activate your Notify account. After the first sign-in, you need to include your clientId and secret key in the http headers. You can find this information in the user settings page where the Notify credentials are.

Once that is set up, you have to make an API call. Go to https://rapidapi.com/geert/api/notify-eu/ in the code snippets, select (Ruby) net::http and copy-paste it in Visual Studio Code. Make sure to add these 3 gems:
require 'uri'
require 'net/http'
require 'openssl'

After, a message will be sent to your inbox. You can check the logs in the Notify app to see what was sent.

Next, you need to select the smtp channel and configure it with its unique key.

MESSAGE TEMPLATE
Create a new template and assign your selected channel. Add the content such as the text and logo. In the HTML editor, you need to add {{ fullName }} next to Greetings and  {{ projectName }} next to project.

In Visual Studio Code, you need to call the Rocket Elevators contact form in order for these variables to print in your message. 
\"name\": \"" + @lead.full_name + "\",
\"email\": \"" + @lead.email + "\"

TESTING
Once your code is complete, you can go on the Rocket Elevators’ website, fill out the form and you should receive a confirmation email in your inbox with the full name and the project name you entered. To troubleshoot, you can check in Notify’s Log tab to make sure the api as well as the content work.

### Freshdesk

When a potential customer submits their contact information through the Contact Us form on the home page, or when he/she calculates a quote using the quote form, all the information, including any attachments from the contact form, are sent to Freshdesk to allow Rocket Elevators to manage their leads and quotes more easily.

When an employee fills out an intervention form, an email is sent in a form of a ticket with all the informations from the form to Freshdesk so that the follow-ups are easier to do and keep track of.

Please contact us for login credentials to the freshdesk console.

### AWS Polly

When an admin logins into the admin panel, they have the option to play an audio briefing of some key information derived from the database. The link to play this audio is on the bottom left as "Play Briefing" under "Links".

### Dropbox

When a lead becomes a customer, the admin have the option to send any relevant files associated with the lead to be sent to Dropbox. To do this, they need to click on the "show-in-app" button next to the lead they want to mark. The button will prompt Dropbox to save all the relevant files, and any files saved in the MYSQL database will be erased. 

### Google Maps

Admin now has the option to view a map of where their customers' buildings are located. Simply login into admin and click on "Show Customers On A Map" on the bottom left of the admin homepage under "Links". Once you are on the map, you are able to click on the markers to view detailed information about the building. 

### Slack

Steps to configure slack:
- create an app
- Add the app to the workspace
- Install the slack-notifier gem
- Create a web hook  and adding it to you code

### Twilio

When an elevator status is changed from any non-Intervention status to "Intervention" a text message is immediately sent to the technician in charge of the elevators alerting him that an elevator needs to be checked and gives him the elevator ID at the same time. You can try this very easily by changing an elevator status in the admin pannel.
